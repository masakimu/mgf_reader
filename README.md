# mgf_reader

A tiny python parser for peak list file in the [Mascot Generic Format (MGF)](http://www.matrixscience.com/help/data_file_help.html) which is implemented as python generator for each spectrum. I will add properties to read standard MGF header items. 
This reader could also treat a simple tab/comman separated peaklist which contain single spectrum.
